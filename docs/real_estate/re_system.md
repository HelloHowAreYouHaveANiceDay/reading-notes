# Real Estate Systems

The development industry is cyclical and strongly linked to the general macroeconomic business cycle.

From the investment analysis prospective, the development industry is a converter of financial capital into physical capital as a feedback link from the asset market to the space market.

## the real estate system

includes three parts, **the space market**, **the asset market**, and the **development industry**

**the systems dynamics model** is a visual overview of the system and linkages between these three major components

## Four Quadrant Model

depicts four binary relationships that complete links between the space market, the asset market, and the development industry.

the 4Q model examines the **long-run equilibrium** within all markets. Long run equilibrium allows the markets sufficient time for the supply of space to adjust to the demand.

Equilibrium is represented by a rectangle whose sides are vertical and horizontal connects between four points, one point one each of the four binary relationship lines.

The four axis are:

1. stock of built space
   1. equilibrium represented as Q\*
2. rent
   1. equilibrium represented as R\*
3. asset prices
   1. equilibrium represented as P\*
4. rate of new construction in the market
   1. equilibrium represented as C\*
