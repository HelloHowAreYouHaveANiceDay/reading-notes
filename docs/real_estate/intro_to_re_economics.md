# Into to Real Estate Economics

_Replacement Cost_ - The level of rent that is just sufficient to stimulate profitable new development and tends to be the long run equilibrium-rent in the market

_cap rate_ = annual net income / building value

_property market_/_asset market_ is the market for the ownership of real estate assets, consisting of land parcels and the buildings on them.

Assets are essentially claims to future cash flows. (rent buildings generate for owners)

_public markets_ are those in which small homogeneous units of ownership in assets trade in public exchanges in which many buyers and sellers are simultaneously participating in the market with prices for all to observe.

**informational efficiency** - ability for asset prices to respond quickly to relevant news.

## Private Markets

**private markets** are markets in which assets are traded in private transactions arranged between individual buyers and sellers who found each other through a search process often via the aid of brokers.

**whole assets** entire companies or properties

private markets are generally less liquid. It takes more time for sellers and buyers to find each other and ascertain a fair price for the given whole asset.

Transaction costs are higher as a fraction of the value of the asset being traded. (ie, broker fees)

It is more difficult to observe the prices at which assets are trading and the public observability of the price may be delayed.

Whole assets are generally unique, and not sold repeatedly very frequently.

## Debt and Equity

Debt assets are the rights to future cashflows paid out by borrowers of loans (interest or retirement of principal). They also give their owners senior claim for obtaining the cash that the underlying asset can generate.

Debt cashflows are contractually specified, so the recipients know more precisely with relative certainty how much future cash flow they will be will be receiving, and when.

Equity assets are those that give their owners residual claim to the underlying asset. Equity owners typically have more control over the managing of the assets and benefit from growth or upside in the potential cash flows.
