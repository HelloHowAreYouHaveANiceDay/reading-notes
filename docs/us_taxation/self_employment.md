## Accounting methods

### Cash

Taxpayers report income when they **constructively receive** it.

constructive reception occurs when the income is credited to their account or made available to them without restrictions. It matters not when the taxpayer takes possession of the cash but when **they are entitled to the cash**

Taxpayers deduct expenses when they pay the cash, but only if the **expenses relate to the current or a previous tax year**. Cash basis taxpayers who prepay must wait until it is used in their business to deduct.

### Accrual

income includes amounts earned or accrued but not received. It acts on the right to receive revenue rather than the actual receipt of cash, and acts on the use of the asset or service rather than the actual cash payment.

prepaid expense are accounted for the same way under both cash and accrual. Dedcut only the amounts allocable to the given tax year with the remainder carrying forward.

prepaid income can be spread across the current and next year if goods and services sold extend beyond the current tax year.

May accrual method payers do not have to accrue service revenue that experience indicates is not collectable.
