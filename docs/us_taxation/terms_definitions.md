## Double declining balance method

An **accelerated depreciation method** also known as the reducing balance method. This method records larger depreciation expenses during the earlier years of an asset's useful life, and smaller ones in later years.

"Double" means 200% of the straight line rate of depreciation. "Declining balance" refers to the asset's book value at the beginning of the accounting period. Book value is an asset's cost minus it's accumulated depreciation.

``` code
$100,000 book value of new purchase on jan 1 with no salvage value and a 10 year useful life.

Year 1:
book value = $100,000
20% double decline = 100,000 x .20 = $20,000 of depreciation.

Year 2:
book value = $80,000
20% double decline = 80,000 x .20 = $16,000 of depreciation

Year 3:
book value = $64,000
20% double decline = 64,000 x .2 = $12,000 of depreciation

Year 4:
book value = $51,200
20% double decline = 51,200 x .2 = $10,240 of depreciation

Companies can elect to switch to straight line depreciation for remaining years.

::: warning
double declining balance depreciation method will cause the company's net income in the nearly years of an assets life to be lower than the straight line method.

::: tip
this method is used when there is a combination of depreciation expense and maintenance expenses. Maintenance is usually lower in the earlier years of an asset's life, so accelerated depreciation can balance later maintenance costs.
