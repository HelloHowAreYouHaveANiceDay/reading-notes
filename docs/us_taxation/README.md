# US Taxation

### Assignment of income doctrine

Income cannot be assigned to a person who did not originally earn it

### Basis

amount of cash paid for the property and the fair market value of other property provided in the transaction.

ex: 20,000 cash + 7,500 loan = 27,500 basis

### Business purpose

Tax avoidance is not a proper motive for being in business.

### Capital asset

Everything owned and used for personal purposes, pleasure, or investment.

### Cash basis

Income is reported when it is received

### Claim of right

Amounts received by an individual under claim of right must be included in gross income even though the individual might have to refund the amount at a later time.

### Conduits

Entities that are not tax paying but pass through their income (loss) to owners.

### Constructive-receipt doctrine

When a cash basis individual receives income, or credited to an account the individual may draw upon, or set aside for the individual, the individual has constructively received the income. Once an individual has an absolute right to the income, it must be recognized.

ex: savings interest. it's earned whether or not the money is withdrawn.

### Entity

for tax purposes there are four types:

- individuals
- corporations
- trusts
- estates

Entities are the taxpayer.

### Gross income

all taxable income.

### Holding period

length of time that the property has been held by the taxpayer. Relates to capital gains transactions. Short vs long depends on whether the asset has been held for more than 12 months.

### Income

Gain derived from capital

### Income-shifting

Transfer of income from one family member to another who is subject to a lower tax rate. OR selection of a form of business that decreases tax liabilities.

### Pay as you go

Gain or loss is **realized** when a transaction is completed. Not all gains and losses are **recognized** (taxed). a recognized gain or loss occurs when a taxpayer is obligated to pay tax on a completed transaction.

### substance vs form

### Taxes benefit rule

### Taxable income

for corporations: gross income minus all deductions. for individuals: gross minus exemptions and deductions.

### wherewithal to pay

taxpayer should be taxed on a transaction when he/she has the means to pay.

ex: taxpayer owns property that's increasing in value. Tax is paid when the taxpayer sells the property.

Couples might arrange their wedding date in December versus January

taxpayers with dependents under multiple support rules can use bunching.

most tax benefits favor business owners and taxpayers who itemize
