# Tax Terms

## Accrual Basis
income is accounted for as and when it is earned, whether or not it has been collected.

## Assignment of income doctrine
Income cannot be assigned to a person who did not originally earn it

## Basis
amount of cash paid for the property and the fair market value of other property provided in the transaction.

ex: 20,000 cash + 7,500 loan = 27,500 basis

## Business purpose
Tax avoidance is not a proper motive for being in business.

## Capital asset
Everything owned and used for personal purposes, pleasure, or investment.

## Cash basis
Income is reported when it is received

## Claim of right
Amounts received by an individual under claim of right must be included in gross income even though the individual might have to refund the amount at a later time.

## Conduits
Entities that are not tax paying but pass through their income (loss) to owners.

## Constructive-receipt doctrine
When a cash basis individual receives income, or credited to an account the individual may draw upon, or set aside for the individual, the individual has constructively received the income. Once an individual has an absolute right to the income, it must be recognized.

ex: savings interest. it's earned whether or not the money is withdrawn.

## Entity
for tax purposes there are four types: individuals, corporations, trusts, estates. Entities are the taxpayer.

## Gross income
all taxable income.

## Holding period
length of time that the property has been held by the taxpayer. Relates to capital gains transactions. Short vs long depends on whether the asset has been held for more than 12 months. 

## Income
Gain derived from capital

## Income-shifting
Transfer of income from one family member to another who is subject to a lower tax rate. OR selection of a form of business that decreases tax liabilities.

## Pay as you go
periodic collection through withholding

## realized vs recognized gain or loss.
Gain or loss is **realized** when a transaction is completed. Not all gains and losses are **recognized** (taxed). a recognized gain or loss occurs when a taxpayer is obligated to pay tax on a completed transaction.

## substance vs form

## Taxes benefit rule

## Taxable income
for corporations: gross income minus all deductions. for individuals: gross minus exemptions and deductions.

## wherewithal to pay
taxpayer should be taxed on a transaction when he/she has the means to pay.

ex: taxpayer owns property that's increasing in value. Tax is paid when the taxpayer sells the property.

# Individual Taxation

Gross Income - Deductions for Adjusted Gross Income = Adjusted Gross Income

Deductions Include:
- Trade or business expenses
- Reimbursed employee expenses
- Moving Expenses
- Losses from sale or exchange of property

## Adjusted Gross Income

## Itemizing vs Standard Deduction

## Limitations on Itemized Deductions

Married taxpayers even filing jointly must choose to both itemize or take the standard deduction

## Personal Exemptions

a child is not allowed the personal exemption if it is claimed on the parent's return

generally the amount = amount of expense incurred.
if support is lodging or property, fair market value is used.
**value of personal services is not included**

if the taxpayer owns the home, the fair rental value of the lodging furnished is part of support. Adults and children are not treated equally as housing adults generally has more costs.

amount paid to others to care for children while working counts as part of support. May also qualify for dependent care credit.

amounts received as scholarships at an educational institution are not considered in determining whether the taxpayer furnishes more than one-half the support of the student.

- no single person contributed to more than 50%
- each member of the group did not contribute more than 50%
- member claiming the dependent contributed more than 10% of support
- all other persons in the group with more than 10% writes a declaration that they will not claim dependent

## filing status and requirements

there are file filing statuses
- married individuals filing jointly
- married individuals filing separate returns
- single individuals
- heads of households
- surviving spouses

"abandoned spouse" is qualified if:

- taxpayer files a separate return
- taxpayer's spouse cannot be a member of the household in the last 6 months
- taxpayer contributes more than 50% of the cost of living
- taxpayer's residence is child's primary residence for more than 50% of the year.
an abandoned spouse can claim head of household status.

### married individuals filing jointly

a joint return is not allowed if either partner is a non-resident alien during the tax year or if they are on different tax years.

joint returns combine
- income
- deductions
- exemptions

both spouses are jointly liable for any tax liabilities

in the event a spouse or both dies, a joint income can still be filed provided the surviving spouse does not remarry within a year.

### married individuals filing separately

separate returns will result in approximately the same tax liability as a joint return if both spouses have approximately equal amounts of income. 

when incomes are unequal, it's generally better to file join returns.

special circumstances for separate returns
- one spouse incurs significant medical expenses
	- smaller adjusted gross income in separate return results in higher medical deduction.
	- medical expenses can can be claimed when >7% of adjusted gross income.
- guard against potential risk on one persons return if there is uncertainty

in **community property** states, a married couple's income is treated as earned equally by both spouses. However, income earned on capital investment remains the separate property of that spouse.

Texas, Idaho, and Louisiana income from separate property is treated as community property.

### single individuals

unmarried person who does not qualify as head of household. Where incomes are approximately equal, total tax may be smaller if unmarried.

### head of households

unmarried individuals who maintain a household for dependents can use head of household rates. 

unrelated persons, even if claimed as dependents, do not count towards head of household status. Only relatives can serve this purpose.

over 50% of the cost of maintaining the household must be by the taxpayer

unmarried children and grand children are not automatically a taxpayer's dependent. However, under the head of house hold claim, **if** the child or grandchild **is married** the dependency exemption rules must apply for the child to be claimed as a dependent.

the household must be the principal residence for more than 50% of the year.
