# Tax Terms

## Accrual Basis
income is accounted for as and when it is earned, whether or not it has been collected.

## Assignment of income doctrine
Income cannot be assigned to a person who did not originally earn it

## Basis
amount of cash paid for the property and the fair market value of other property provided in the transaction.

ex: 20,000 cash + 7,500 loan = 27,500 basis

## Business purpose
Tax avoidance is not a proper motive for being in business.

## Capital asset
Everything owned and used for personal purposes, pleasure, or investment.

## Cash basis
Income is reported when it is received

## Claim of right
Amounts received by an individual under claim of right must be included in gross income even though the individual might have to refund the amount at a later time.

## Conduits
Entities that are not tax paying but pass through their income (loss) to owners.

## Constructive-receipt doctrine
When a cash basis individual receives income, or credited to an account the individual may draw upon, or set aside for the individual, the individual has constructively received the income. Once an individual has an absolute right to the income, it must be recognized.

ex: savings interest. it's earned whether or not the money is withdrawn.

## Entity
for tax purposes there are four types: individuals, corporations, trusts, estates. Entities are the taxpayer.

## Gross income
all taxable income.

## Holding period
length of time that the property has been held by the taxpayer. Relates to capital gains transactions. Short vs long depends on whether the asset has been held for more than 12 months. 

## Income
Gain derived from capital

## Income-shifting
Transfer of income from one family member to another who is subject to a lower tax rate. OR selection of a form of business that decreases tax liabilities.

## Pay as you go
periodic collection through withholding

## realized vs recognized gain or loss.
Gain or loss is **realized** when a transaction is completed. Not all gains and losses are **recognized** (taxed). a recognized gain or loss occurs when a taxpayer is obligated to pay tax on a completed transaction.

## substance vs form

## Taxes benefit rule

## Taxable income
for corporations: gross income minus all deductions. for individuals: gross minus exemptions and deductions.

## wherewithal to pay
taxpayer should be taxed on a transaction when he/she has the means to pay.

ex: taxpayer owns property that's increasing in value. Tax is paid when the taxpayer sells the property.
