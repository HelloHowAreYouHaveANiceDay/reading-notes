# gross income

income has slightly different concepts depending on which perspective it is viewed from.

## economic income

"maximum amount a person can consume during a week and still expect to be as well-off at the end of the week as he was at the beginning." J.R. Hicks, _value and capital_ (Oxford: Claredon Press, 1946)

assumes that there were no capital contributions or withdrawals during the period measured.

## tax concept of income

gross income includes "all income from whatever source derived" unless specifically exempt by law.
