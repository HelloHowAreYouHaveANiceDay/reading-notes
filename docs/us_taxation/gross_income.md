# gross income

income has slightly different concepts depending on which perspective it is viewed from.

## different concepts of income

### economic income

"maximum amount a person can consume during a week and still expect to be as well-off at the end of the week as he was at the beginning." J.R. Hicks, _value and capital_ (Oxford: Claredon Press, 1946)

assumes that there were no capital contributions or withdrawals during the period measured.

### tax concept of income

gross income includes "all income from whatever source derived" unless specifically exempt by law.

### accounting income

income is the excess of revenues over the costs incurred in producing those revenues. Emphasis is on completed transactions. Unlike the economic view, the accounting view does not recognize holding gains. Deals with exclusively objective measurable forms.

::: tip
gains must be **realized** before they are includible in income.

in the accrual method of accounting, income is recognized when the transaction is complete.

## Three income doctrines

the three doctrines focus on what is income, when it is taxable, and to whom is it taxable.

### Economic benefit doctrine

addresses the "what"

Code Sec. 61(a)

Taxable income may consist of:
- Cash
- receivables
- property
- land
- any other form of economic benefit

### constructive receipt doctrine

addresses the "when"

conceived in order to prevent the taxpayer from choosing the year in which to reduce income to possession.

once the individual has an **absolute right** to the compensation, the amount **must be included** in income.

if the individual only has **condition right**, then **no present income** was received.

### assignment of income doctrine

addresses the "who"

Solves the issue when individuals try to limit tax liability by assigning income to a different party.

Income is taxable to the individual who has earned it. Assignment of income is disregarded unless the **source of the income is also assigned**

``` code
person A owns property but assigns rent to child A.

person A remains liable for the tax on rent even if income is received by child A


as a repayment plan on a loan, child B sends half of a paycheck to person B who is her creditor. Child B is still taxed on her full paycheck.
```

Assignment between married couples filing separate returns may vary between state and state. **community property laws** have a large influence over assignment.

## community property income

there are eight community property states
- arizona
- california
- idaho
- louisiana
- nevada
- new mexico
- texas
- washington

All property acquired by a husband and wife after marriage is considered community property. **Any income** from these properties is automatically considered joint income.

Property acquired before marriage or inherited by one spouse during marriage is considered separate property. Whether income from these properties are communal income depends on state.

if two individuals
- are married to each other during some part of the calendar year
- live apart for the entire tax year
- do not file a joint return
- one or both have earned income
    - none of which is transferred between them
then:
1. earned income is treated as income of the spouse who provided the service
2. trade or business income is treated as the husband's income unless the wife exercises substantially all of the management and control of the business.
3. community income derived from separate property of one spouse is treated as income of that spouse and that spouse only.
4. all other community income is taxed according to community property law.

### tenancy by entirety

if property is held by a married couple as tenants by the entirety, all income must be included by the husband in his return or must be shared equally between husband and wife depending on state law.

in states that have no common law rule, the income is split in half between husband and wife's return.

### joint tenants and tenants in common

parties holding property as joint tenants each report income proportional to their interest in the property.

When one party dies, the interest is transferred to the remaining parties.

When all tenants in common dies, the property is passed to heirs.
