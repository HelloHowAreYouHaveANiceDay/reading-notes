# Depreciation and Amortization

1. it must be property you own
2. it must be used in your business or income producing activity
3. it must have a determinable useful life
4. it must be expected to last more than one year.

## Depreciation of Business Property

**depreciation expense** represents the portion of the property's cost written of each year because of wear and tear, deterioration, and normal obsolescence.

The speed of depreciation depends on:

1. whether the property is real property or tangible personal property
2. when the property is placed in service.

Real property is:

- real estate
  - office buildings
  - apartments
  - manufacturing plants
  - warehouses
  - LAND is NOT depreciated

Tangible personal property is:

- not real estate
- furniture
- machinery
- equipment
- vehicles

The depreciation rules in effect **in the year the asset is placed into service** applies during the entire time the taxpayer owns the property.

Depreciation expense reduces an asset's adjusted basis, even if the taxpayer fails to deduct it on a return. The adjusted basis must be reduced by the **greater** of depreciation allowed or allowable (is deducted or taxpayer is entitled to deduct).

Overlooked depreciation expense can be claimed for 3 years after the the tax return on which the expense is unclaimed. After three years, overlooked depreciation cannot be claimed, but it still reduces the basis on the asset.

::: tip
sole proprietors deduct depreciation on their business property in Schedule C
Rental property is deducted on Schedule E
Other investment property is claimed on Schedule A as a miscellaneous itemized deduction subject to the 2% AGI floor

## Depreciation of Tangible Personal Property

Occasionally tax laws are passed to speed up the recovery process by allowing taxpayers to deduct larger than normal amounts in the first year. This is usually done to encourage businesses to purchase additional new assets.

### Bonus first year depreciation

There is usually a percentage bonus on the first year of putting an asset into service. For example, from sept 9 2011 to dec 31 2011 the bonus percentage was increased to 100%

### Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)

Under MACRS, personal property is assigned a life of 3, 5, 7 10, or 15 years, regardless of it's actual life.

5 year life class includes:

- vehicles
- office equipment
  - copiers
  - fax machines
  - computers
  - printers

7 year life class includes:

- furniture and fixtures
- machinery
- equipment other than office equipment

3, 5, 7, 10 year property uses a 200% declining balance
15 year uses a 150% declining balance
if straight-line method yields a greater deduction, it is then used.

MACRS ignores salvage value. Taxpayers multiply the percentage from the table by the property's MACRS basis.

MACRS basis begins with the unadjusted basis, which is the taxpayer's total cost for use at its operating location, including:

- purchase price
- sales tax
- any delivery and installation costs.

Section 179 expenses or bonus depreciation in the first year is subtracted from the basis.

The unadjusted basis of nonbusiness property that a taxpayer converts to business or investment use equals the lessor of the taxpayers adjusted basis or its fair market value on the conversion date. Special rules apply to property acquired by exchange, gift, or inheritance.

### averaging conventions

half-year convention: applies when 60% of the MACRS basis of personal property is placed in service during the year is place in service during the first nine months of the year.

mid-quarter convention applies when more than 40% of the MACRS basis of personal property is placed in service during the year is placed in service during the last three months of the year.

#### Half Year convention

when 60% of all property placed during service is during the first nine months, then **all property placed** in service that year is depreciated using the half-year convention.

under this convention, property is assumed to be place into service half way through the year and will be disposed of in its last year at the half year mark.

Refer to the MACRS table for rates.

#### Mid-Quarter Convention

This convention was started to counteract businesses buying all their assets at the end of the year to take advantage of the half year convention.

This convention assumes that the asset was put into service in the **middle of the quarter** of which they are put into service. It is also assumed that it is disposed of in the middle of the quarter of the actual sell date, regardless of which quarter it was purchased in.

### Election Choices

Taxpayers can elect to not use the standard MACRS can elect to use straight-line MACRS or the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS)

#### Straight-line MACRS

Election to use straight-line can be made annually for each class of property (# of useful lifetime years). The year one depreciation method does not have to be the same as the next year.

#### Alternative Depreciation System

In ADS most properties have longer recovery periods than under MACRS. The half-year and midquarter conventions apply to ADS as well.

Tax-payers can usually choose between 150% declining balance or straight line method.

Personal property with no designated class life has a recovery period of 12 years under ADS.

Once a taxpayer elects to depreciate a specific class of property using ADS, that election for that class of property **cannot be revoked**

### Section 179 Expense Election

Defined as "tangible personal property purchased by the taxpayer and used in a trade or business"

The amount of section 179 property that can be expensed in the first year is reduced one to one when exceeding \$200,000. Married couples filing separately can each claim one half of the couple's allowed amount. The maximum expense is calculated on form 4562 Part I.

Section 179 Expense can only be claimed in the first year they are placed in service. After the 179 election, half of the rest of the unadjusted basis can be recovered using bonus, MACRS, or ADS.

### Listed Property Limitations

Listed property that the taxpayer does not use more than 50% of the time for business does not qualify for regular MACRS, bonus depreciation, or Section 179 first-year expense. Instead, it must be depreciated under ADS straight line.

For transportation it would be based on miles used for business in relation to total miles.
