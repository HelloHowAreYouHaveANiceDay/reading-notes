# C Corporation Taxation

## Nature

Historically, a business is taxed as a corporation if:

1. Business associates
2. A purpose to carry on a business and divide the profits
3. Continuity of life
4. Centralized management
5. Limited liability
6. Free transferability of ownership interests

### Formation

Owners exchange cash, property, and/or services for equity in the corporation.

When non-cash property is transferred to the corporation, each investor realizes gain or loss between the fair market value of the stock and the investor's adjusted basis. If the resulting ownership is more than 80% then no party recognizes gain or loss on the transfer.

## Corporate Taxable Income

Corporations have no personal taxes to deduct.

### accounting methods

Accrual: report income when it is earned, regardless of when the cash is received. Also, they deduct expenses when they are incurred, regardless of when they are paid.

Cash: income is taxable when received, and expenses are deductible when paid. 

Hybrid: combines cash and accrual methods. Here, the accrual method is used to compute gross profit from the sale of inventory and the cash method is used for all other income and deductions

### accounting periods

Corporations can elect to use a calendar or fiscal year.

### Short Tax Years

short tax years can occur at the beginning or ending year of the company, as well as any time in between when the corporation chooses to change tax years.

All corporations need permission from the IRS to change their tax year. (Form 1128)

### Corporate Taxable Income Formula

Deductions that require special computations:

1. Charitable Contribution (CC)
2. Dividends Received Deduction (DRD)
3. Domestic Production Activities (DPA)
4. Net Operating Loss carrybacks (NOL)
5. Short term capital loss carrybacks (STCL)

``` code
  Gross Income
- Deductions(all but CC, DRD, DPA, NOL carryback, STCL carryback)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
= Taxable income used to compute CC deductions
- Charitable contribution (CC) deduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------
= Taxable income used to compute DRD
- Dividends received deduction (DRD)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
= Taxable income before DPA deduction and carrybacks
- DPA deduction
- NOL carryback
- STCL carryback
-----------------------------------------------------------------
= Taxable Income
```

### Income Items

#### Gross Profit from Sales

Net Sales are gross sales less returns and allowances

``` code
  net sales
- cost of goods sold
---------------------
= gross profit from sales
```

corporations can deduct **sales discounts** directly from sales or treat them as a business expense

#### Capital Gains and Losses

Corporations report sale of capital assests on Schedule D (form 1120)

Corporations do not get reduced tax rate on net capital gains.

Capital gains are recorded separate from other income because they can **only** be deducted against capital losses
