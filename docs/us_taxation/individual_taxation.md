- Trade or business expenses
- Reimbursed employee expenses
- Moving Expenses

**value of personal services is not included**

#### no joint return test

dependent cannot be filed as a dependent on more than one return.

#### social security number

#### multiple support agreements

in cases where no single person contributed for more than 50% of the support

- no single person contributed to more than 50%
- each member of the group did not contribute more than 50%
- member claiming the dependent contributed more than 10% of support
- all other persons in the group with more than 10% writes a declaration that they will not claim dependent

#### divorced or separated parents

#### high income phaseout of exemptions

### filing status and requirements

there are file filing statuses

- married individuals filing jointly
- married individuals filing separate returns
- single individuals
- heads of households
- surviving spouses

"abandoned spouse" is qualified if:

- taxpayer files a separate return
- taxpayer's spouse cannot be a member of the household in the last 6 months
- taxpayer contributes more than 50% of the cost of living
- taxpayer's residence is child's primary residence for more than 50% of the year.
an abandoned spouse can claim head of household status.

#### married individuals filing jointly

a joint return is not allowed if either partner is a non-resident alien during the tax year or if they are on different tax years.

joint returns combine

- income
- deductions
- exemptions

both spouses are jointly liable for any tax liabilities

in the event a spouse or both dies, a joint income can still be filed provided the surviving spouse does not remarry within a year.

#### married individuals filing separately

separate returns will result in approximately the same tax liability as a joint return if both spouses have approximately equal amounts of income.

when incomes are unequal, it's generally better to file join returns.

special circumstances for separate returns

- one spouse incurs significant medical expenses
  - smaller adjusted gross income in separate return results in higher medical deduction.
  - medical expenses can can be claimed when >7% of adjusted gross income.
- guard against potential risk on one persons return if there is uncertainty

in **community property** states, a married couple's income is treated as earned equally by both spouses. However, income earned on capital investment remains the separate property of that spouse.

Texas, Idaho, and Louisiana income from separate property is treated as community property.

#### single individuals

unmarried person who does not qualify as head of household. Where incomes are approximately equal, total tax may be smaller if unmarried.

#### head of households

unmarried individuals who maintain a household for dependents can use head of household rates.

rates are usually lower than for single taxpayers or surviving spouses but higher than joint filings.

unrelated persons, even if claimed as dependents, do not count towards head of household status. Only relatives can serve this purpose.

over 50% of the cost of maintaining the household must be by the taxpayer

unmarried children and grand children are not automatically a taxpayer's dependent. However, under the head of house hold claim, **if** the child or grandchild **is married** the dependency exemption rules must apply for the child to be claimed as a dependent.

the household must be the principal residence for more than 50% of the year.

Cost of maintaining a household include:

- property taxes
- mortgage interest
- rent
- utility charges
- upkeep and repairs
- property insurance
- food consumed on premises

they do not include:

- clothing
- education
- medical treatment
- vacations
- life insurance
- transportation
- services rendered in household by the taxpayer
  - such as cleaning, cooking, or doing laundry

#### Surviving Spouses (qualified widow)

A surviving spouse is a taxpayer whose spouse died in either of the two years preceding the tax year and has not remarried. They may file if they maintain a household for dependents.

Surviving spouses use the same tax rates as married taxpayers but do not authorize the spouse to file jointly, only allows them to use the rates.

The surviving spouse must also qualify as head of household.

Exemption for the deceased spouse is available in the year of death but not two years following death.

### Dependents

Standard deduction for dependents is the dependent's income plus $250 up to the maximum allowable standard deduction or $750 total. Individual over 18 or full time student over 23 will not qualify as a dependent if income exceeds $3000.

if a dependent child

1. is under 14 years of age at the end of the tax year
2. has more than $1500 of net unearned (investment) income for the year.
3. has one living parent at the close of the tax year.

then their net unearned income is taxed to the child at the additional rate of the tax that the parent would pay if the child's income is included in the parents' taxable income.

income of custodial parent is used for tax computation.

if parents are unmarried, then the greater taxable income is used when taxes are filed separately.

#### net unearned income

Net unearned income is "unearned" such as:

- interest
- dividends
- capital gains
- trust income

it has to be:

1. less than $750
2. or the amount of allowable deductions which are directly connected with the production of unearned income.

``` code
Child A has $800 of earned income and $400 of unearned income.

 $  800 earned
+$  250
-------
 $ 1050 standard deduction

 $ 1200 gross income
-$ 1050 standard deduction
-------
 $  150 taxable income


since unearned income is less than $1500, there is no net unearned income.


 Child B has $400 of earned income and $1700 of unearned income.

 $ 2100 gross income
-$  750 standard deduction
-------
 $ 1350 taxable income

 $ 1700 unearned income
-$  750 first $750 clause
-$  750 standard deduction
-------
 $  200 net unearned income

$200 net unearned income is taxed at parent's rate.

 $ 1350 taxable income
-$  200 net unearned income taxed at the parent's rate.
-------
 $ 1150 taxable income taxed at Child B's rate

```

### Filing requirements

obligation to file depends on
- amount of gross income
	- only income which is taxable is included in the calculation
- marital status during the year
- age

#### tax tables

tax tables only apply to taxable income of less than **$100,000**

each line represents an interval of incomes.

``` code
<$3000
intervals are $25
>$3000
intervals are $50
```

Tax in tables is determined by the midpoint taxable income in each interval.

#### tax rate schedules

those unable to use tax tables can use tax schedules to determine their tax obligation.

#### self employment tax

used so self employment also is taxed for social benefits.

``` code
  gross income from business as a sole proprietor
- allowable deductions
+ distributive share of partnership's net income
--------
  net self-employment income
```

not all self-employment income is taxed.

- service pay for newsboys under 17.
- dividends taxed only for dealers
- interest only on business loans
- rental income only by real estate dealer or if services are provided for occupants.
- items generally excluded from gross income
- wages received by a child under 18 from a parent

``` code
  self employment income
- special deduction
------
  net earnings from self employment


  net self-employment income
x 1/2 self-employment tax rate or 7.65%
-------
  deemed deduction

```

the taxpayer is allowed a deduction for 1/2 the self-employment tax as a deduction from gross income

``` code
person A had $45000 in self employment income. deductable expenses were $15000

 $ 45000 gross income from self employment
-$ 15000 business expense deductions
--------
 $ 30000 net self-employment income

 $ 30000 net self-employment income
x  7.65% 1.2 self-employment tax rate
--------
 $  2295 deem deduction

 $ 30000 net self-employment income
-$  2295 deem deduction
--------
 $ 27705 net earnings from self-employment

 $ 27705 net earnings from self-employment
x  15.3% self-employment tax rate
--------
 $  4239 self-employment tax obligation

```

one half of the self employment tax liability for the year is allowed as a deduction on the tax return. The deduction is taken from gross income on 1040.

if net earnings from self-employment are less than $400, there is no self employment tax.
