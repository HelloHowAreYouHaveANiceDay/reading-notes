# Learning how to learn

notes on the learning to learn coursera course

## Two modes of thinking

### Focused

Focused on targeted task.

### Diffused

Allows random ideas to connect

## Brain

### Working memory

4 major slots held in the hippocampus

## chunking

chunking unites bits of information together through meaning with use.

Interspace focused and diffused learning.

### How to form a chunk

Get a sense of general patterns. Grasp and master mini chunks through practice and then stitch them together into a mega chunk

1. focus on the subject
2. understand the basic idea (the gist)
   a. without understanding a chunk is useless
   b. grasping an idea is not the same as being an expert
   c. gain mastery by doing
3. gain context
   1. understand how and when
   2. bottom up (chunking)
   3. top down (big picture)
      1. skimming over a chapter before diving in

### Illusions of competence

Recall is more effective than rote re-studying. The retrieval process itself helps build pattern pathways.

when a concept is well chunked, only one slot of working memory should be needed to leverage it.

Use notes on the side rather than over highlighting.

When the material is present there's allusion that it is in one's head.

Recall in other places that are not where you learned the material avoids spatial cues that can hinder recall in unfamiliar environments like those at a test center.

### Motivation

Acetylocholine: helpful for focused learning

Dopamine: Reward chemical. helpful for motivation.

Serotonin: affects social life. Linked to risk taking.

### Library chunks

Gradually build the amount of chunks in their minds

Similar chunks across fields, called **transfer**

Sequential thinking involves the focused model

Diffused mode gives intuition and random connections that need to be verified by focused model.

### Overlearning

Continuing to hammer at an idea in a session is less helpful than recall and repeating it in a later practice session.

**Deliberate Practice** practice increasingly challenging aspects of the concept

**Einstellung** an initial thought prevents a better solution from being found.

Unlearning bad old ideas to learn new ones ends up being more wasteful.

**Interleaving** Re-approaching the same concept through different perspectives or mindsets.

## Procrastination and Memory

procrastination is like poison

you shouldn't need to use will power to fend off procrastination

Irrational excuses is a sign procrastination

Habits are energy savers.

Habits have four parts:

1. The Cue
2. The Routine
   a. the zombie mode. how the brain responds.
3. The reward
4. The belief

to change habits you have to change underlying belief.

### Process vs product

negative feelings about studying is normal

focus on process not the product. The product is what produces the pain. Habits are more helpful for process.

### building out of procrastination

1. the cue
figure out what's causing procrastination. Location/time/feelings or reactions.

2. the routine
develop a new plan and routine.

3. reward
habits are powerful because they create neurological connections.
The better you get at something the better it will feel.

4. the belief
believe that your new routine works.

### juggling life and learning

organize todos. write the list helps the brain understand how to plan for them. Task list frees memory for problem solving.
