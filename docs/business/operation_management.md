# Operations

## Four dimensions

1. Cost
    a. efficiency
        1. labor
        2. customers/space
2. Quality
    a. product quality
        1. ambience
        2. courtesy
    b. process quality
        1. freshness
3. Variety
    a. customer heterogeneity
        1. items on the menu
        2. percent of item requested
4. Time
    a. responsiveness to demand
        1. turn around time

Two ways of competitive advantage **cost leadership** or **differentiation**

## Efficiency frontier

There's always operation tradeoffs.

The efficiency frontier is where redesigned process smarter and reducing waste in the system, offsetting trade-offs and allowing the company to move up and to the right on both axes.

This helps companies decide which of the four dimensions they should improve upon.

## Process Analysis

### Core Terms

cumulative inflow = Time x cumulative number of customers
cumulative outflow = Time x cumulative number of customers leaving

unit/time is the slope

Flow Rate:
horizontal difference is flow time
number of flow units going through the process per unit of time

Inventory:
number of flow units in the process at a given moment in time
inflow - outflow
vertical difference is inventory

inventory is anytime there is a mismatch between supply and demand

Flow Time:
time it takes a flow unit to go from the beginning to the end of the process

Unit:
Atomic unit of analysis

### Bottle Neck

Processing Time: how long is spent on the task

Capacity: 1/processing time. How many units can the worker make per unit of time if there are m workers at the activity. Capacity = m/processing time

Bottleneck: process step with the lowest capacity

Process Capacity: capacity at the bottle neck.

Flow Rate: Minimum Demand rate or Process Capacity

Utilization: Flow Rate / Capacity

Flow Time: The amount of time it takes a flow unit to go through the process

Inventory: number of flow Units in the system.

### Labor cost and Utilization
