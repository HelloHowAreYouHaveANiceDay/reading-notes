# Operations

## Four dimensions

1. Cost
    a. efficiency
        1. labor
        2. customers/space
2. Quality
    a. product quality
        1. ambience
        2. courtesy
    b. process quality
        1. freshness
3. Variety
    a. customer heterogeneity
        1. items on the menu
        2. percent of item requested
4. Time
    a. responsiveness to demand
        1. turn around time

Two ways of competitive advantage **cost leadership** or **differentiation**

## Efficiency frontier

There's always operation tradeoffs.

The efficiency frontier is where redesigned process smarter and reducing waste in the system, offsetting trade-offs and allowing the company to move up and to the right on both axes.

This helps companies decide which of the four dimensions they should improve upon.

## Process Analysis

### Core Terms

cumulative inflow = Time x cumulative number of customers
cumulative outflow = Time x cumulative number of customers leaving

unit/time is the slope

Flow Rate:
horizontal difference is flow time
number of flow units going through the process per unit of time

Inventory:
number of flow units in the process at a given moment in time
inflow - outflow
vertical difference is inventory

inventory is anytime there is a mismatch between supply and demand

Flow Time:
time it takes a flow unit to go from the beginning to the end of the process

Unit:
Atomic unit of analysis

### Bottle Neck

Processing Time: how long is spent on the task

Capacity: 1/processing time. How many units can the worker make per unit of time if there are m workers at the activity. Capacity = m/processing time

Bottleneck: process step with the lowest capacity

Process Capacity: capacity at the bottle neck.

Flow Rate: Minimum Demand rate or Process Capacity

Utilization: Flow Rate / Capacity

Flow Time: The amount of time it takes a flow unit to go through the process

Inventory: number of flow Units in the system.

### Labor cost and Utilization

Cycle time = 1/flow rate
how much time passes between the flow of two units

Direct Labor Content: sum of processing times

Direct Idle time = sum of (cycle time - processing time)

Average Labor utilization = Labor Content/Labor Content + Direct Idle Time

Cost of direct Labor = total wages per unit of time / flow rate per unit of time.

::: tip Why labor costs matter to the value chain
Companies that purchase products or services from contractors or suppliers are just shifting the labor cost out of their books and into the books of the supplying company. As you roll up the total cost across the value chain a greater percentage is given to logistics and labor.

example: Foxcon's labor force in Apple's value chain.

### Little's Law

Inventory = Flow Rate * Flow Time

Out of the three fundamental performance measures, two can be chosen by management, the other is given by nature.

If flow rate is held constant, then reducing inventory would reduce flow time

### Inventory Turns

Inventory turns is the amount of time a dollar spends inside the operation. There is a cost advantage to turning over inventory faster than competitors.

Inventory Turns = Cost of goods sold / Inventory

Inventory cost, the cost to the company to hold inventory for a year. Most major companies incur a capital cost of 10%

Inventory turn capture how well you are using working capital.

### Make to stock vs Make to Order

variability

buffer or suffer:
in a system that cannot buffer variability, flow rate will suffer.

Sandwich waits for customer, or customer waits for sandwich.

Make to Stock is better:
Scale economies in production
Rapid Fulfillment (short flow time)

Make to Order is better:
Fresh preparation (flow time for sandwich)
More customization (don't hold all versions of a sandwich)
Produce exactly the quantity needed

Reasons for Inventory

1. Pipeline Inventory: need inventory because flowtime is greater than 0
   1. little's law.
2. Seasonal Inventory: driven by seasonal variation but constant capacity
    1. Steady production but varied demand
3. Cycle Inventory: Economies of Scale in Production
4. Safety Inventory: Buffer against demand
5. Decoupling Inventory/Buffers: Buffer between internal steps.

### Multiple Flow Units

Build a resource and demand matrix to calculate the demand on resources based on the units that flow through that resource.

Total Demand / Capacity = Implied Utilization

Units can be genericized to "minute of work" units. This allows you to join differentiated flow units. Works well with processes with attrition loss. Shows, Sales leads, Underwriting.

## Productivity

Productivity = Units Output Produced / Input Used
