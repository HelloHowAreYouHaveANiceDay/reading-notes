# Founders Agreement

## Founding questions

### Strategy

what goals does each of us have for the start-up?

what goals does the startup have?

what is the timeline to achieve these goals?

### Ownership

who gets what percentage

how will the tasks be distributed

how much capital are we each contributing

what is the vesting structure of said ownership

### Management

how are key decisions vs day to day decisions being made?

what salaries are the founders entitled to, and what modifications will be placed on that?

what happens if someone wants to exit the business

when a founder leaves, does the company or other founders have the option to buy back that founder's shares? At what price?

what happens when one founder wants to dramatically change the state of the company? (sell, kill, or raise money)

what happens upon founder disability or death?

can founders launch other startups while working on this project?

under what circumstances can a founder be removed as an employee of the business?

if a founder is not living up to the expectations of the founding document, how is this handled?

in the case the venture fails, can another founder use the idea and try it again.

## Sections

the following details the outlining of the agreement and various pros and cons of certain positions and their alternatives.

All Founders of this Business Concept should be party to this agreement, which lays out, among other things, the rules over who owns the Business Concept. Persons who contributed significantly to the Business Concept, but are not part of this agreement, may attempt to assert a legal claim of ownership over the Business Concept and the resulting business.

### Transfer of ownership

The Founders agree to transfer their rights to the Business Concept to the Company in order to avoid disputes about ownership of the Business Concept. This Company will be created and owned by the Founders. This transfer prevents one of the Founders from stealing the Business Concept created by the Founders and forming an independent business. Furthermore, future investors will invest only in companies that clearly own their Business Concept. In the event litigation arises, this provision makes it clear that the Business Concept is owned by the Company.

Some agreements contain restrictions on the transfer of ownership interests, but outside investors often frown upon these restrictions.

- Permitted Transfers
  - Permitted transfers restrict transfers after the Company is formed, but permit certain transfers to closely related people, such as immediate family members, affiliates, and controlled entities (such as family trusts). In addition, owners are often allowed to transfer their ownership stake to other interest holders, free of restrictions
- Right of First Offer
  - The right of first offer requires the owner of a percentage interest to offer the interest to the other interest holders before offering to sell to third parties. If the interest holders do not buy the percentage interest, the owner usually has a limited period of time to sell to a third party, but that sale must be on terms no more favorable than those offered to the other interest holders.
- Right of First Refusal
  - The right of first refusal is similar to the right of first offer, except that the selling owner offers to sell the percentage interest to the other interest holders after receiving a bona fide third party offer. The offer to the interest holders must typically be made on substantially the same terms offered by the third party. The selling owner describes the terms of the third party offer to the other interest holders. This is a big difference from the right of first offer because the interest holders do not know the identity of the third party purchaser when deciding whether or not to buy the offered percentage interest.

### Ownership Structure

- consider whether equity should be equally split
  - equal is not automatically the best option
  - with an even split, a decision making deadlock provision is needed that clearly specifies how decisions get handled. The company should not risk a deadlock in the case of poor decision making climate.

- factors that may be considered for unequal distribution
  - who came up  with the idea that is the key to the Business Concept
  - who has the greatest stake in the IP
  - who developed the technology to run the business
  - who owns the patents
  - whether existing copyrights or trademarks are brought in by founders
  - which founders are providing the start-up capital for the concept
  - how much time each founder invested in the development of the business
  - whether all founders will be full time contributors
  - opportunity cost for each founder
  - who has the industry expertise

setting aside 10-20% of interest for future employees is a common way to motivate high level employees

#### Vesting

Vesting provisions govern how long it takes for Founders or others to take ownership over their stake in the Company.

If a company has a standard four-year vesting term with a one-year cliff, the Founder does not actually possess its ownership stake until certain time periods have elapsed. The Founder accrues 1/48th of their ownership interest every month, but does not actually receive their accrued ownership stake until the end of year one of continuous and consecutive employment at the company.

Not actually owning the first year’s worth of accrued Founders’ Collaboration Agreement ownership until after a year of working for the company is called a cliff. Vesting with a cliff encourages commitment for at least the first year. After that first year, if the Founder leaves the company, they can walk away with the amount of interest that they actually own. 

### Compensation

### Non-compete

### Confidentiality

Both the Company’s Founders and its future investors have a stake in ensuring that the Company protects its intellectual property (part of the Business Concept) and avoids infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties. Intellectual property (IP) is often the most valuable asset for many start-ups. A problem arises, however, if one of the Founders leaves prior to entity creation and takes his rights to certain IP along with her. Another problem often arises with respect to IP created pre-entity creation by outside developers or consultants (i.e., non-Founders), particularly if the developers or consultants are located outside of the United States. The IP created often never gets assigned to the company at all, either because there was no written agreement or because the company was not a party to the agreement (because it did not exist at the time).

### Representations and Warranties

### Choice of law
