Descriptive and Inferential Statistics

## Cases Variables, and Levels of Measurement. Data, and Visualization

Variables are features of something or someone

Cases are instances of something or someone

Cases must have variation across characteristics.

Constants are characteristics that do not change across cases.

### Levels of measurement

Nominal: has difference but no order (ex: nationalities of players, gender of players)
Ordinal: has difference AND order

Interval: has difference, order, and similar intervals (ex: age of players)
Ratio: has Difference, order, similar intervals, and a meaningful zero point. (ex: height of players)

statistical methods leverage different types of variables.

### Data matrix and frequency table

Data matrix is basically a table. Cases in rows and variables in columns

A single data point is called an observation

Frequency tables shows how the values are distributed over the cases

converting quantitative variables into ordinal ones allow you to build your frequency table.

### middle tendencies

mean, median, mode

### Range, interquartile range, and box plot

in order to describe a distribution, you need much more than just middle tendencies

range is the difference between the largest and lowest value

IQR leaves out the extreme values and divides cases into 4 equal parts. Q3 - Q1 = IQR. IQR is not affected by outliers.

### Variance and Standard Deviation

variance measures the variability.

square root of the variance is the standard deviation. average distance of an observation from the mean.

### Z scores

z score = number of standard deviations from the mean.

used to tell whether an observation is common or exceptional.

what is considered exceptional depends on the shape of the distribution curve

75% should lie within a z score of -2 to +2
89% should lie within a z score of -3 to +3

## Correlation

Contingency table, displays relationship between to two ordinal or nominal variables. Similar to a frequency diagram but concerns 2 variables instead of 1.

column percentages = cell / total of the column

scatterplots are better for quantitative variables

### Pearson's r

expresses direction and strength of linear correlation

pearson's r only works on linear relationships. Do not use on non-linear correlations.

### Regression

residual is the difference between the case and the candidate line of best fit

the line with the one with the sum of the square residuals is the smallest.

the line is called a regression line

the method is called linear regression analysis

r squared tells you how much better the line is than the mean as a predictor. r squared says nothing about direction, but shows how much of the variance of the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable.

### Correlation is not causation

## Probability

a samples space is the collection of all possible outcomes for a random phenomenon

event is a subset of the sample space

### Sets

disjoint: events that do not share outcomes. (mutually exclusive)

jointly exhaustive: events that cover the whole sample space

not disjoint: 

### Union

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
