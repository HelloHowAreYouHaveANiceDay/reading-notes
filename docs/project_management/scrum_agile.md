# Scrum

Scrum is based on making decisions based on what is known and employs an integrative, incremental approach to control risk.

Three major pillars of scrum:

- Transparency
  - The process must be visible to those responsible for the outcome
  - Aspects must be defined by a **common standard** so observers share a **common understanding** of what is seen.
- Inspection
  - Users must be able to tangibly see progress towards a goal and easily detect problems.
  - Inspections should not get in the way of work.
- Adaptation
  - If a problem exists and is properly detected, the the natural thing is to adjust the process as soon as possible to minimize the problem.

## Events

## Roles

### Product Owners

responsible for maximizing the value of the product.

- Clearly express Product Backlog items
- Prioritize items in alignment to the goal
- Optimize the value of the work of the Development Team
- Ensure that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all.
- Ensure the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog.

The Owner is a single person, not a committee. They must solely own the Backlog's items, and the priority of them.

### The Development Team

Those who do the work of delivering the goals.

- They self organize
- Own the method by which the backlog is turned into functionality
- Cross functional and owns the capabilities to produce
- No titles
- No subteams
- Individual members will have special skills or areas of focus but accountability is bore by the whole team.

### The Scrum Master

Responsible for promoting and supporting scrum. Helps everyone understand theory, practices, rules, and values behind scrum.

## Terms

## Sprints

sprints are short, time-boxed periods when a team works to complete a set amount of work.

Make sure:

- Team sets and understand the goal and how success will be measured.
- Backlog is well groomed with both priorities and dependencies in order.
- You understand the team's velocity, including leave and meeting time.
- Team uses the planning meeting to flesh out details of the work that needs to be done.
- Recalibrate sprints based on team concerns.
- Leave out work where you won't be able to get the dependencies done.
- Everyone captures information in the same project management tool.

Be careful not to:

- overestimate your team's capabilities and set yourself up for failure
- underestimate quality assurance or technical debt
- let the team go into the sprint unclear of what's going on
- let the team go into the sprint unaligned
- don't take on a large amount of high risk work.

### Sprint Planning

a collaborative event where teams answer:

- What work can get done in this sprint?
- How will the work get done?

the **product owner** discusses the objective and the **product backlog** items that would achieve the sprint goal.

Answer:

1. The What
   1. Objective of the sprint
   2. What items contribute to the goal
2. The How
   1. Plan work to deliver the goal
   2. Negotiation between development team and product owner
3. The Who
   1. Both the product owner and the team need to be present
4. The Inputs
   1. Start with the backlog
5. The Outputs

### Standup

during a sprint, the team checks in during a daily scrum called the **standup** about progress. The goal is to surface any blockers or challenges that would impact the sprint goal.

### Sprint Review

Showcase work to stakeholders

### Sprint Retrospective

Identify areas of improvement for the next sprint
