# Project Management

Project management is an umbrella term for a series of frameworks and methodologies to align goals between people and optimize the resources in or between organizations. While there are numerous approaches that were each designed for specific types of production, ultimately the success of any project management system is dependent on the success of the organization that is leveraging it.

Program management differs from operations management in that tasks involved in operations are usually repetitive and permanent.

## The Five Phases
