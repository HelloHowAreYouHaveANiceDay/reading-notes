# Learning how to learn

notes on the learning to learn coursera course

## Two modes of thinking

### Focused

Focused on targeted task

### Diffused

Allows random ideas to connect

## Brain

### Working Memory

Working memory holds information available to the task at hand. There are roughly 4 slots held in the hippocampus.

## chunking

chunking unites bits of information together through meaning with use.

Interspace focused and diffused learning to form chuncks of relationships in your mind

### How to form a chunk

Get a sense of general patterns. Grasp and master mini chunks through practice and then stitch them together into a mega chunk

1. focus on the subject
2. understand the basic idea (the gist)
   a. without understanding a chunk is useless
   b. grasping an idea is not the same as being an expert
   c. gain mastery by doing
3. gain context
   1. understand how and when
   2. bottom up (chunking)
   3. top down (big picture)
      1. skimming over a chapter before diving in

### Illusions of competence

Recall is more effective than rote re-studying. The retrieval process itself helps build pattern pathways.

when a concept is well chunked, only one slot of working memory should be needed to leverage it.

Use notes on the side rather than over highlighting.

When the material is present there's illusion that it is in one's head.

Recall in other places that are not where you learned the material avoids spatial cues that can hinder recall in unfamiliar environments like those at a test center.

### Motivation

Acetylocholine: helpful for focused learning

**Dopamine**: Reward chemical. helpful for motivation.

**Serotonin**: affects social life. Linked to risk taking.

### Library chunks

Gradually build the amount of chunks in their minds

Similar chunks across fields, called **transfer**

Sequential thinking involves the focused model

Diffused mode gives intuition and random connections that need to be verified by focused model.

### Overlearning

Continuing to hammer at an idea in a session is less helpful than recall and repeating it in a later practice session.

**Deliberate Practice** practice increasingly challenging aspects of the concept

**Einstellung** an initial thought prevents a better solution from being found.

Unlearning bad old ideas to learn new ones ends up being more wasteful.

**Interleaving** Re-approaching the same concept through different perspectives or mindsets.
