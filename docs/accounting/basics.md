# Accounting Basics

## Accrual vs Cash

the two different methods of accounting will determine how and when transactions are recorded and on which accounts.

### Cash Basis

Most people's intuitive understanding of recording transactions. Transactions are recognized when cash is exchanged. Revenues recognized when cash is received and expenses recognized when they are paid. In accounting this method is considered inferior due to the fact that when the cash transaction occurs can be very different from the activity that generate the transaction (i.e. getting paid for services or goods a month later than when it was sold).

It is followed usually by individuals or small companies and is **not in compliance** with accounting's matching principle.

### Accrual Basis

Transactions are recognized when they are earned rather than when cash is received. Accounts Receivable, Unearned Revenues, Accounts Payable, are some additional accounts used in accrual accounting to conform to the **revenue recognition principle** where revenues are required to be shown in the statement period in which they are earned rather then when cash is collected.

## Bookkeeping

Double Entry accounting is the essential practice in accounting. The core concept is that **every transaction** will result in amounts recorded in at least two of the accounts in the system.

### Chart of Accounts

A detailed list of accounts that cover all the transaction in the business is required to get a accurate picture. While the specific accounts will vary from business to business, a standard set of accounts and terms for them are usually used and come built in into many accounting software. The following list illustrates what a possible list of accounts can look like.

## Reports

Reports give insights into how the business is doing.

### Income Statement

the income statement will show how profitable a business is. It reports on two things, the amount that was earned (**revenue**), and **expenses** necessary to earn that revenue.

### Balance Sheet

a report that show three aspects of the company, **assets**, **liabilities**, and **stockholders equity** at a point in time.

### Statement of Cash Flows
