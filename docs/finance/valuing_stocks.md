# Valuing Stocks

The law of one price states that the price of a security should equal the present value of the expected cash flows an investor will receive and the appropriate cost of capital.

## Dividend Discount Model

an investor can gain cashflow from a stock in two ways, one is a dividend, the other, the difference when the investor sells the stock.

Because of the risk of these cash flows, they must be discounted based on the **equity cost of capital**. It is the expected return of other investments available in the market with equivalent risk.

when an investor would be willing to buy the stock.

Payment[0] <= ( Dividend[1] + Payment[1]) / (1 + Equity cost of capital)

when an investor would be willing to sell the stock

Payment[0] >= (Dividend[1] + Payment[1]) / (1 + Equity Cost of capital)

Every buyer of a stock must have a seller, so both equations must hold.

Payment[0] = (Dividend[1] + Payment[1]) / (1 + Equity Cost of capital)

### Dividend Yields, Capital Gains, and Total Returns

**Dividend Yield** is the expected annual dividend of the stock divided by the current price and is the percentage return the investor expects to earn from the dividend paid by the stock.

**Capital Gain** is the difference between the expected sale prices and the purchase price of the stock. Payment[1] - Payment[0]

Capital Gain / Stock Price = **Capital Gain Rate**

**Total Return of the stock** is the dividend yield plus the capital gain rate.

### Multiyear Investor

P[0] = (Dividend[1]/(1+Rate[equity]) + ((Dividend[2] + P[2])/(1 + Rate[equity])^2)...

**Dividend Discount Model** is therefore:

P[0] = (Dividend[1]/(1+Rate[equity])+...((Dividend[n] + P[n])/(1 + Rate[equity])^n)

The price of the stock is equal to the present value of the expected future dividends it will pay.

## Dividend discount model applications

The simplest forecast for the firm's future dividends is that they will grow at a constant rate forever.

**Constant Dividend Growth Model** = Dividend[1]/(rate[equity] - rate[growth])

Rate[equity] = (Dividend[1]/Payment[0]) + Rate[growth]

### Simple Model Growth

Dividend[t] = (Earnings[t] / Shares Outstanding[t]) \* Rate[dividend payout]

a firm can thus raise its dividend in three ways:

1. increase earnings
2. increase dividend payout rate
3. decrease shares outstanding

Cutting a firm's dividend to increase investment will raise the stock price if and only if the new investments have a positive NPV.
