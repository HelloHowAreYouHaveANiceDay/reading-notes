# Discounted Cash Flow Application

## Net Present Value (NPV)

the NPV represents the present value of expected cash inflows less the present value of expected outflows.

Steps to calculate NPV:

1. identify all costs (outflows) and benefits (inflows) associated with an investment
2. determine the appropriate discount rate or opportunity cost for the investment
3. using the discount rate, find the PV of each cashflow.
4. Compute NPV as the sum of discounted cash flows.

## Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

rate of return that equates the PV of inflows with the PV of costs.

alternatively discount rate for which the NPV of an investment is 0.

## NPV decision rule

- Accept projects with positive NPV
- Reject projects with negative NPV
- When two projects are mutually exclusive, accept the project with higher NPV

## IRR decision rule

- Accept projects with an IRR greater than the required rate of return
- Reject projects that are less than the firm's required rate of return

## Holding Period

Holding period return is the percentage change in the value of an investment over the period it is held.
