# Capital Markets and Risk Pricing

The **standard deviation** of a return is often referred to as **volatility**

**expected return** is the mean return as a weighted average of possible returns where the weights correspond to probabilities.

## Historical Returns

**realized return** is the return that actually occurs over a period of time.

**realized return** = Dividend Yield + Capital Gain Rate

Holding the stock past the first dividend means that how the dividend is reinvested must factor into the return equation.

**Empirical Distribution** of returns is a histogram of historic returns.

**average annual return** is just the average of realized returns each year.

**standard error** is the standard deviation of the average return.

## Trade-off between Risk and Return

Investments with higher volatility should have a higher risk premium;

**excess return** is the difference between the average return for the investment and the average return for Treasury bills. This measures the risk premium investors earned for bearing the higher risk of the investment.

## Common vs Independent Risk

**common risk** is risk that is perfectly correlated

**independent risks** are risks that share no correlation

**diversification** is the averaging out of independent risks in a large portfolio

## Diversification

Fluctuation of a stock's return that are due to **firm specific news** are independent risks. Referred to as **firm-specific**, **idiosyncratic**, **unique**, **diversifiable risk**

Fluctuations of a stock's return that are due to **market wide** news represent common risk. This type of risk is also called **systematic**, **undiversifiable**, **market risk**
