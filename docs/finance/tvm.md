# The Time Value of Money

Equilibrium interest rates are the required rate of return for a particular investment.

Time Line: diagram of cash flows associated with time value of money problems. Present day is at time zero, with payments as negatives and receipts as positive.

## Future Value (FV)

The process to calculate FV is called compounding

FV = PV x (1+periodic rate of return)^total number of periods

future value factor: (1 + periodic rate of return)^ total number of periods


## Present Value (PV)

The process to calculate PV is called discounting

FV / (1 + periodic rate of return)^number of periods

present value factor or discount factor: (1 + periodic rate of return)^ total number of periods

## Equilibrium

equilibrium interest rates are the required rate of return for a particular investment.

the market rate of return is what investors require to willingly lend their funds.

Opportunity Cost: the amount that would be gained if the funds were in an investment rather than current consumption.

## Risk Free Rate

The **real risk-free rate** is the theoretical interest on a loan that has no inflation.

The **nominal risk-free rate** includes an **inflation premium**. This is what the U.S. Treasury bill rate is.

nominal risk-free rate = real risk-free rate + expected inflation rate

Types of risk

1. default
2. liquidity
3. maturity


## Effective Annual Rate (EAR)

the annual rate of return actually being earned after adjustments have been made for different compounding periods

EAR = (1 + periodic rate)^number of compounding periods - 1

## Annuities

**Ordinary Annuities**
cashflow occurs at the end of each compounding period

**Annuities Due**
cashflow occurs at the start of each compounding period

## Loan Payments and Amortization

Interest component = beginning balance x periodic interest rate

Principal component = Payment - Interest

## Future Obligation
