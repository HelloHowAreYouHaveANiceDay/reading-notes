# Financial Statement Analysis

Financial statements are accounting reports with past performance information issued by firms.

US companies are required to file with the SEC every quarter on 10-Q and annually on 10-K

There must also be an annual report to shareholders.

## Preparation of Financial Statements

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the guideline for public companies.

Corporations are also required to hire an auditor to ensure that the financial statements are reliable.

## The Balance Sheet

The balance sheet is the statement of financial position listing assets and liabilities.

The Difference between a firm's assets and liabilities is the **Stockholder's Equity**, also called the book value of equity.

Assets = Liabilities + Stockholder's Equity

### Assets

**current assets** are either cash or assets that could be converted into cash within one year.

- cash and other marketable securities. Low risk, short term investments that can be easily sold and converted to cash. (short term bonds)
- Accounts Receivable
- Inventories
- Other current assets, such as prepaid expenses.

**long term assets** are those that are not immediately liquid, and includes things like machinery or equipment.

**depreciation expense** is the reduction in value recorded each year over the lifetime of an asset.

The **book value** of an asset is it's acquisitions cost - depreciation

The difference between a price paid for a company and its **tangible assets** are considered **goodwill** and **intangible assets**

The depreciation of intangible assets is called **amortization** or **impairment charge**

### Liabilities

**current liabilities** are those that will be satisfied within one year.

- accounts payable
- short term debt
- salary or taxes that are owed but not paid.

**net working capital** = current assets - current liabilities

**long term liabilities** extend beyond one year

- long term debt
- capital leases
- deferred taxes

### Stockholder's equity

**book value of equity** = assets - liabilities

The number is likely not a true assessment of the firms value as the asset values are based on historic values rather than evaluated at the current time. additionally, there are many assets that are not captured such as expertise, reputation and relationships.

### Market Value vs Book Value

Market Value of Equity = Shares outstanding x Market price per share

Market value is often referred to as **market capitalization**

Market-To-Book Ratio indicates the relationship between market capitalization and the book value of stockholder's equity. also called **P/B ratio**

PB ratio = Market Value of Equity / Book Value of Equity

Low PB ratios are often labeled **value stocks** while high market to book rations are considered **growth stocks**

**total enterprise value(TEV)** assess the value of the underlying business assets without debet and separate from any cash and marketable securities. Also the "cost to take over the business": buy all equity, pay off debt, and adjust for cash.

Enterprise Value = Market Value of Equity + Debt - Cash

## The Income Statement

also the statement of financial performance. or **profit and loss** statement

**net income** is the measure of profitability during the period. Also referred to as _earnings_

Earnings show the flow of revenues and expenses generated by the firm's assets.

**gross profit** lists revenues from sales of products - **cost of goods sold**, which includes directly related costs but excludes things like administrative and rnd expenses.

gross profit = total sales - cost of goods sold(COGS)

**operating expenses** are incurred during the regular course of operating the business, and not directly related to costs of goods sold.

**operating income** = gross profit - operating expense(admin, RnD, depreciation and amortization)

**earnings before Interest and Taxes** includes any other income that are not core to the company's business.

EBIT = operating income + other income

**Pretax and Net income** is EBIT further deducted by interest expense.

Net income represents total earnings of the firm's equity holders. It can be used to report the **earnings per share** number.

EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding.
