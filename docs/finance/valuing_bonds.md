# Valuing Bonds

if you own a bond, you are entitled to a fix set of cash payoffs until maturity, where you'll get the last interest payment and the **face value** of the bond, which is the bond's principal.

Interest on government bonds are the benchmark for all interest rates. When government interest rates go up or down, corporate rates follow more or less proportionally.

The fixed set of cash payoffs is called the bond's **coupon**, usually expressed as a percentage.

The PV of a bond is equal to the sum of two different investments. One that is an annuity of coupon payments, the other is the Face Value.

US coupons are paid semiannually

**Term** is the time until the bond expires

**Maturity Date** is the day when the bond expires and the face value is received

**Yield to Maturity** is the discount rate that sets the PV of the promised payments equal to the current price. (market discount rate)

Yield to maturity is the rate of return of the bond. Because you are usually paying more than face value, you lose the difference by holding the bond to maturity. However, this is offset by the coupon payments. The yield to maturity number blends the return from the coupon payments with the declining value of the bond over its remaining life.

**Par** when bond is traded at price equal to the face value. YTM = coupon rate

**Discount** when bond is traded at price less than face value. YTM > coupon rate

**Premium** when bond is higher than face value. YTM < coupon rate

## How Bond Prices Vary with Interest Rates

Change in interest rates have a greater impact on prices of long-term bods than on those of short-term bonds.

Yield to maturity is defined as the discount rate that explains the bond price. Therefore, when bond prices rise, YTM must fall and vice versa. In the market when interest rates fall, the price of bonds will rise, increasing the value for holders of those bonds.

The bond that pays out a larger portion of it's value closer to the end is considered a longer term bond. (lower coupon, higher FV)

**Macaulay duration** is the measure of average maturity and predicts the exposure of each bond's price to fluctuation in interest rates.

Duration is the weighted average of the times to each cash payment. The weight is calculated by the PV of cashflow received divided by total PV of the bond.

**Volatility** (also called modified duration) = duration / 1 + yield
