# Valuing Bonds

if you own a bond, you are entitled to a fix set of cash payoffs until maturity, where you'll get the last interest payment and the **face value** of the bond, which is the bond's principal.

Interest on government bonds are the benchmark for all interest rates. When government interest rates go up or down, corporate rates follow more or less proportionally.

The fixed set of cash payoffs is called the bond's **coupon**, usually expressed as a percentage.

The PV of a bond is equal to the sum of two different investments. One that is an annuity of coupon payments, the other is the final value of the principal.

Yield to maturity is the rate of return of the bond. Because you are usually paying more than face value, you lose the difference by holding the bond to maturity. However, this is offset by the coupon payments. The yield to maturity number blends the return from the coupon payments with the declining value of the bond over its remaining life.

A bond sells at a **premium** when its asking price is higher than its face value. Investors who buy this bond expects to face a capital loss over the life of the bond, so the yield to maturity is lower than current yield.

A bond sells at a \**discount*8 when its asking price is lower than the face value. Investors who buy this bond expects a capital gain over the life of the bond, so yield to maturity on a discount bond is greater than the current yield.

US coupons are paid semiannually

## How Bond Prices Vary with Interest Rates

Change in interest rates have a greater impact on prices of long-term bods than on those of short-term bonds.
