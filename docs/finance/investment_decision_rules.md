# Investment Decision Rules

## NPV Rule

Take the investment with the highest NPV.

**NPV Profile** is a graph of the project's NPV over a range of discount rates. This visualizes the uncertainty over cost of capital.

## IRR Rule

Take the investment where the IRR exceeds the opportunity cost of capital. Turn down investments where the IRR is less than cost of capital.

## Payback Rule

Looks at the payback period. Take the investment where cash flows pay back its initial investment within a period.

## Choosing between Projects

### NPV rule and mutually exclusive investments

pick the project with the highest positive NPV

### IRR Rule and mutually exclusive investments

if projects differ in scale of investment, timing of their cash flows, or their riskiness, then their IRRs cannot be meaningfully compared.

Because IRR is a return, you cannot tell how much total value is actually created without knowing how big the investment was.

IRR also does not account for the timing of cash flows. NPV shows that with a same IRR, a longer term project is more valuable than a short term project.

Risk is also not accounted for in IRR.

## Incremental IRR

when choosing between two projects, the incremental IRR can be calculated by first computing the incremental cashflows and then computing the IRR. This metric shows the discount rate at which it would be profitable to switch from one project to another.

the same issues with IRR is also present in Incremental IRR

## Project selection with resource constraints

### Profitability Index

Profitability index = Value Created / Resource Consumed = NPV / Resource Consumed

For profitability index to work, 1. the set of projects must completely exhaust the available resources. 2. There is only a single relevant resource constraint.
