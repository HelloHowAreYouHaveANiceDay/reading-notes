# Capital Budgeting

a **capital budget** lists the projects and investments that a company plans to undertake during the coming year.

The first step is to determine the **incremental earnings** of a project.

**Incremental Earnings** is the amount by which the firm's earnings is expected to change as a result of the investment decision.

## Incremental Earnings Forecast

**straight line depreciation** is where the asset's cost less any salvage value is divided equally over its estimated useful life time.

**interest** is usually not included in the calculation to separate a firm's financing decisions from the investment decision.

**unlevered net income** is net income without interest associated with debt.

**unlevered net income** = EBIT x (1 - Marginal Tax Rate)

**marginal corporate tax rate** is the tax rate it will pay on an incremental dollar of pre-tax income.

## Indirect Effects on Incremental Earnings

**opportunity cost** of using a resource is the value it could have provided in its best alternative use.

Idle assets have opportunity costs alternative uses can generate cash flows.

**project externalities** are indirect effects of the project that may change the profitability of other activities.

**cannibalization** is when sales of a new product displaces sales of an existing product.

**sunk costs** is any unrecoverable cost for which the firm is already liable. _if the decision does not affect cash flow, then the cashflow should not affect the decision_

**overhead expenses** are associated with activities that are not attributable to a single business activity. Only the additional overhead expenses that arise from the decision should be included in the project cost.

## Free cash flow and NPV

**depreciation** is not included as a cash expense as it is not actual cash flow. Instead the purchase cost is used.

The difference between accounts payable and accounts receivable is known as **trade credit** as it measures the credit from suppliers or lent to customers.

**Net Working Capital** = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

**Free Cash Flow** = (Revenue - Costs - Depreciation) \* (1 - Marginal Tax Rate) + Depreciation - CapEx - Change in Net Working Capital

can also be written as

**Free Cash Flow** = (Revenue - Costs) \* (1 - Marginal Tax Rate) - Capex - Change in NWC + (Marginal Tax Rate \* Depreciation)

**Depreciation Tax Shield** = Marginal Tax Rate \* Depreciation

PV(Free Cash Flow at T) = Free Cash Flow at T / (1 + rate) ^ T

## Project Analysis

In **break even** analysis, each parameter is calculated to for an NPV of zero.

**Sensitivity Analysis** breaks the NPV calculation into component assumptions and shows how the NPV varies as the assumptions change.

**Scenario Analysis** considers the effect on NPV of changing multiple project parameters as parameters are often dependent on each other.
